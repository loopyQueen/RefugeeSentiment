Remaining Questions
_____
- tweets about the everyday lives of already 
  resettled refugees are not relevant.
    Ex: "Afghan Refugee kid educated in Iran wins this year's Mathematics Olympiad for Iranian students"
- What about tweets that are clearly
  strongly emotional but it is entirely
  unknowable if it is happy or angry
  without context?
    Ex: "There are no asylum seekers here!#Afghanistan" (modded)
- What about tweets that are clearly
  relevant and emotional, but the stance
  is entirely unknowable w/o context?
    Ex: "Tell that to the female Afghan refugee that wants to get an abortion in Texas after she was raped"
- There is no hope in this dataset.
  Do I mention that in my writeup, or 
  just not do that section without 
  mentioning it?
